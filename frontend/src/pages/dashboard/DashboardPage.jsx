          Chess, one of the oldest and most celebrated board games in the world,
          has a rich history dating back over a thousand years. Its origins can
          be traced to ancient{" "}
          <span className="font-bold text-orange-400">India</span>, where a game
          called <span className="font-bold">chaturanga </span> was played
          around the 6th century AD. This early version of chess involved
          strategic warfare between infantry, cavalry, elephants, and chariots,
          which evolved into the pieces we recognize today. The game spread
          through Persia, where it became known as shatranj, and later reached
          Europe during the Middle Ages, undergoing further transformation into
          the modern version we play now.
